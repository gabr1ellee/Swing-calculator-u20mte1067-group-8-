HOW IT WORKS (THE USER INTERFACE)

Below is a structured overview of how the CalculatorApp functions.

1. Overview of the Calculator
   
The calculator is a simple software application featuring buttons for numbers (0-9), arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), a clear function (C), and an equals function (=). It is inspired by traditional electronic calculators, such as the Anita Mk VII, introduced by the Bell Punch Company in 1961, one of the first fully electronic calculators.

This application allows users to:

● Input numerical values and arithmetic operations (e.g., 5 + 3).
● Clear the screen if an error is made.
● Compute the result by pressing =.

2. Functionality and Execution

● User Input Handling :

● When a user selects a number or an operation (+, -, *, /), it is displayed on the screen.
● Pressing “C” clears all input.
● Pressing “=” triggers the computational calculation and displays the result.

● Calculation Process : Upon pressing “=”, the application evaluates the entered expression (e.g., 5 + 3 * 2). It adheres to mathematical operation rules (e.g., multiplication is performed before addition). If an invalid operation is input (e.g., division by zero), an Error message will be displayed.

3. Example Usage

● Step 1: Entering a Calculation:
When a user input numerical values following arithmetic rules, for example. 3, x, 2, or 3, +, 7, The display shows: “ 3 x 2” or “3 + 7”.
● Step 2: Computing the Result:
On pressing “=” sign , The calculator processes the input as follows:“3 x 2 = 6” or “3 + 7 = 10”, And then it displays the outputs. “6”or ”10”.

● Step 3: Clearing the Screen:

Pressing “C” resets the calculator. As a result, The display is cleared, allowing a new calculation to be entered.

4. Error Handling

If an invalid operation is entered (e.g., 10 ÷ 0), the calculator displays “Error”. Pressing “C” to clear the error message, and gives an avenue to restart the calculations.

5. Running the Application

● Step 1. Copy the source code into a Java file (e.g., CalculatorV1.java or CalculatorV2.java).
● Step 2. Compile and execute the program using a Java IDE or the command line.
● Step 3. The calculator interface will be launched, allowing immediate use.
